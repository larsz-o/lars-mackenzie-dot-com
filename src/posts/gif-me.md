Hello! It's been a little while since I've posted anything. I've been pretty busy at work and hopefully I'll be sharing what I've been up to in the next few weeks. But today I was organizing files on my computer I and came across a little animation that I created a while back and decided that it would be a cool thing to post about. 

One of my goals for this year is to improve my motion graphic design skills. I've got the hang of using animation software like Vyond to [create short videos for lessons](https://youtu.be/ICqYKDa4Ow4). I've even [made a birthday card for my mom](https://youtu.be/rt-fVnVopxs).

I want to learn more of the mechanics of animation, though. (In a previous post, I [wrote about creating my first Lottie animations](/blog/still-loading:-lottie-animations/) using After Effects.) So I created a short "trailer" of me to practice different animation techniques. I used After Effects again to create this project. The only external asset I used was my avatar which I had previous designed using Illustrator. I'm happy with the results. The final product has some smooth, interesting movement. I especially had fun with the masking effect to make the text disappear/transition into my name at the end. All in all, a great use of a bit of extra time.

Here it is, in all of its gif glory:

Pretty cool, right? I'm looking for some new projects to keep practicing my skills. Send me a note if you have something you're working on that fits the bill!
