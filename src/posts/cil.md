Since July 2019, I've been working with a group of folks across the country to build four interactive case studies on effective chaplaincy education through the Chaplaincy Innovation Lab's Educating Effective Chaplains initiative. I'm proud to share that the [interactive case studies](https://chaplaincyinnovation.org/training-credentials/case-studies) are now live!

These case study lessons are intended for chaplains across educational settings: from seminaries to CPEs. They help chaplains gain core competencies that they will use in their work. 

As part of my work on this project, I designed learning objectives, storyboards, scripts, animations, branching exercises, and assessment questions. I also developed a React web application that runs the lessons - as one of this group's goal was that they did not want the lessons stuck in any learning management system. This project was a true partnership between web development and learning design - and it was a lot of fun to work with my collaborators, especially Liz Aeschlimann, who was the lead project manager and editor.
