My exciting news for this month is that I purchased a *synthesizer*.

(Yes, my computer is elevated by two boxes)

I've been making short pieces of music for some freelance projects and I decided to finally invest in tool that could make that process a whole lot easier. 

Check out the songs I created this weekend on my [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/lars-mackenzie). 

I'd be curious to hear from other learning (or game) designers who create their own music or ambient sounds. How did you get into it? Where do you drawn inspiration? Would you be into a monthly challenge where you have to create a sound based on a prompt? 

Drop a comment and let me know!
