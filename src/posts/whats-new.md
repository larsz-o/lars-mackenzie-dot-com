WELL hello! I am writing to you from August. It's been a while since my last post (in March). 

I've been pretty busy. In March, we decided to try to buy a house and eventually did. Since then, I've just been pulling weeds and painting walls and sweating a whole lot. It's been really great. 

I also started a new job in February which I am really liking. I get to work from home permanently, which is just such a joyous thing. 

I also get to work with a lot of smart people who know a lot about learning and technology. 

Now that I'm coming up for air again, I'm hoping to spend some time: 
* meeting new people in this town we just moved to
* designing a game or two with learning, curiousity, and exploration at its center
* maybe learning how to install vinyl flooring?? (probably not)
