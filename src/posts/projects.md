Lately, I have too many project ideas and not enough time. Here are some of the things I've been hoping to do over the past few months: 

* learn to play the drums 
* write a book about accessibility, learning, and web design
* write a book about creative learning 
* learn more about creating animations 
* create a pinhole camera
* reorganize my coat closet
* design a new game (about what?)
* create an eBook platform
* figure out the identity of this site - and maybe my identity as a tech/learning/design person

All of this on top of managing the immense suffering that is happening all around us - namely, white supremacist violence. The world is a big and sad place lately and it's hard to focus on anything *extra* while just trying to make it through the day-to-day and somehow try to combat the evil all around us.
