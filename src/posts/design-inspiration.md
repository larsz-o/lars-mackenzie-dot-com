I read [a great Tweet](https://twitter.com/jackmcdade/status/1275449401759035399?s=20) a few months ago that I can't stop thinking about.

My wife is very good at collecting design inspiration already. She's an all around creative person: quilting, painting, knitting, baking. She takes pictures of beautiful things wherever we go. I'm trying to follow her lead and start my own inspiration collection.

As I've been searching for my own insipiration for web design lately, I started scrolling through the camera roll on my phone. No surprise that most of my most beloved pictures feature food and drinks. Here are some of my favorites from the past three months: 

## This ginger seltzer tastes just as good as it looks.

## A dream of a machine: combination tape player/recorder, portable TV, and am/fm radio
One day, I will have a whole garage full of old electronics.

## A real treat: a tiny cortado cup from Intelligensia Coffee Bar in Watertown
I love the line work on this cup. Its size makes it feel like something very special.

## Comic book inspired beer cans -- yes, please
I want sneakers in this color scheme.

## The sight of a great breakfast
I bought this mug at a yard sale benefitting a cat ranch in Austin, TX. I love a cat in a pajamas dreaming of goldfish (also see my fish in the background). Also: oozing cheese!

## Aah Real Monsters?
I am pretty sure I bought this beer just for the can, but I also wasn't disappointed.

That's all for now. What would be in your design inspiration library?
