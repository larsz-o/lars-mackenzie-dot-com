As a human being, I've been "against grades" for a long time. Like many young people, right around middle school I stopped wanting to learn and started feeling stagnated and defeated by grades. I was always a sort of smart and inquisitive kid - I read lots of books and wrote weird stories in my free time - but I lost a lot of my interest in learning when I started in a new and more difficult school. Making good grades become more valued than learning. 

I remember one day I stayed after school to ask my 6th grade math teacher a question about what we were learning in class: multiplying negative numbers together. She asked me to do a few problems on the board and when I come up with the answer without trouble, she told me to go home. It wasn't that I didn't know how to to do the multiplication, but I could not get my head around the concept that two negative numbers could make a positive number. Maybe she didn't know why this happened either and just didn't want to say this to me, but as long ago as that was now, I still remember how she essentially told me that if I know how to implement something, it doesn't matter if I understand it. That was basically the end of my interest in math. 

While I personally believe that there are many, many ways to assess learning without using grades from my own academic experience (attending [a college that doesn't give out grades](https://www.hampshire.edu/)), I am just digging into the literature in this topic. I started reading [De-Testing and De-Grading Schools](https://www.peterlang.com/view/title/22946) yesterday.

There are lots of great essays in the book, but the one that stood out most to me was by Alfie Kohn, "[The Case Against Grades](https://www.alfiekohn.org/article/case-grades/)."

Kohn writes: 

> **Grades tend to diminish students’ interest in whatever they’re learning.**  A “grading orientation” and a “learning orientation” have been shown to be inversely related and, as far as I can tell, every study that has ever investigated the impact on intrinsic motivation of receiving grades (or instructions that emphasize the importance of getting good grades) has found a negative effect.

> **Grades create a preference for the easiest possible task.** Impress upon students that what they’re doing will count toward their grade, and their response will likely be to avoid taking any unnecessary intellectual risks.  They’ll choose a shorter book, or a project on a familiar topic, in order to minimize the chance of doing poorly — not because they’re “unmotivated” but because they’re rational.  They’re responding to adults who, by telling them the goal is to get a good mark, have sent the message that success matters more than learning.

>**Grades tend to reduce the quality of students’ thinking.**  They may skim books for what they’ll “need to know.” They’re less likely to wonder, say, “How can we be sure that’s true?” than to ask “Is this going to be on the test?”  In one experiment, students told they’d be graded on how well they learned a social studies lesson had more trouble understanding the main point of the text than did students who were told that no grades would be involved.  Even on a measure of rote recall, the graded group remembered fewer facts a week later (Grolnick and Ryan, 1987).

These three points are huge. Grades diminish student interest, create a preference for the easiest possible task, and reduce quality of student thinking. In essence, grades impair authentic learning - or make authentic learning even harder. 

A world without grades is possible, but it's often less linear. Teachers must figure out other ways to assess and evaluate student work: by stating what a student did, how much they grew, and how their perspectives have changed due to what they were able to explore and learn over the term of a course. These are subjective assessments, but so are grades. 

I'd like to learn about how "de-grading" a classroom has potential implications for racialized, gendered, and homo/transphobic biases - and how these compare to graded classrooms. I'll be digging up that research next - but I'm inspired by these bits for now and looking forward to having more conversations with faculty about how to de-grade.
